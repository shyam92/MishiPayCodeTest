#  MishiPay Code test by Shyam Bhudia

## Depandacies
- RealmSwift

## Steps to build 
- Install dependancies from Cocoapods, `pod install`

### Things that I would improve
- Ability to add more than one product type. For example multiple quantities
- Unit testing of database layer and the viewModels
- Fetch products from an API which allows more data to be available
